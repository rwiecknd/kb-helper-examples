<h2 id="resolution">Resolution</h2>
<p>There are several options to changing or resetting your password. If you know your current or most recent password, <strong>and</strong> you have enrolled in Okta you can change it by visiting <a href="https://okta.nd.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://okta.nd.edu</a>. If you are unable to change it yourself via that method, the following options are available:</p>


<p><strong>Special Note:</strong> When you change your password, you will need to reauthenticate to all Notre Dame services, including Google Mail, Box, Eduroam, Office 365, CorpFS, etc. In some instances (e.g., 1Password) this will require re-typing your new password.</p>


<p><strong>The timing of re-authentication is close to immediately. To avoid authentication issues during the workday that may interrupt your workflows, you may want to make the password change toward the end of your business hours.</strong></p>

<p>Once you've enrolled in Okta, you are automatically set up for self-service to reset your password. You'll find instructions for doing so <a href="https://nd.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0017394" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</p>


<p><strong>If you are unable to change your password yourself, contact the Service Desk. You will be required to provide information about yourself so that we can verify your identity.</strong></p>
