<h2>Students</h2>


<p>The information below applies to students who graduate.</p>


<p>May 2024 graduates are used as an example. Summer 2023 and December 2023 graduates are considered May 2024 graduates because they can participate in May commencement events.</p>


<ul>
<li>May 2024 graduates lose access to log in to their NetID@nd.edu account approximately 60 days after the last class day for the spring semester.</li>
<li>Some graduate programs (e.g., MBA, Law) receive more than 60 days before NetID account access is removed.</li>
<li>Reminder emails are sent, starting 30 days before account deactivation — approximately 7 or 8 messages in total.</li>
<li>After 60 days, the NetID@nd.edu account is no longer active.</li>
<li>The Google account is suspended 14 days after the NetID account becomes inactive.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>When the Google account is suspended:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The email address is renamed from NetID@nd.edu to delete__NetID@nd.edu (that's two underscores).</li>
<li>Collaborators retain access to previously shared content.</li>
<li>Gmail and Google Drive content is disassociated from NetID@nd.edu and instead associated with delete__NetID@nd.edu.
<ul>
<li>delete__NetID@nd.edu is a holding account for content and not a person.</li>
<li>This temporary account is deleted one year after the original NetID was suspended.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This renaming alerts collaborators that the account is in a deletion state.</li>
<li>First and last name of the account remains unchanged.</li>
<li>All aliases (e.g., NetID@nd.edu, firstlastname@nd.edu) are removed.</li>
<li>Search for content using the person’s name or delete__NetID@nd.edu.</li>
<li>Email sent to a suspended account is undeliverable (bounces).</li>
<li>One year after suspension, the account and all data are permanently deleted.</li>
<li>If the student returns before deletion, they will regain their NetID but <strong>will have no access to Google My Drive content or previous email.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>They will not have access to their previous email.</strong></li>

<h2>Returning to Notre Dame</h2>


<ul>
<li>If a graduated student or previous employee returns to Notre Dame before their Google account has been deleted, they will regain access to their previous NetID@nd.edu but <strong><em>will have no access</em></strong> to any Google content or email they had while previously at Notre Dame.</li>
<li>It’s important to understand: once a person leaves the university, access to former content is permanently forfeited, even upon return.</li>
</ul>
