<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Requesting a Google HSI (Highly Sensitive Information) Shared drive</p>


<p>This article is technical in nature on purpose since the process to create a Shared drive requires approval and following a strict series of steps/requests to verify the need and to correctly create an HSI Shared drive. We request that you work with your local IT Support related to this request.</p>


<p>By default, a Google Shared drive is a secure space to store content and anyone can create a shared drive. However, content with highly sensitive information (HSI) can only be stored in an HSI Shared drive.</p>


<p><strong>HSI Shared Drive</strong>: This shared drive prevents sharing content outside the university and outside the Shared drive team members. The request will be reviewed by the OIT’s Information Security and Compliance team (they are responsible for knowing where all HSI content is stored at the university). The review will take a few days and the form submitter will be contacted by the InfoSec team.</p>


<p>The OIT administrators can also create a <em>Department Use Only</em> Shared drive. This type of Shared drive has the same setup as an HSI Shared drive, but there is no review by OIT’s Information Security and Compliance team and the Shared drive will be available for use in a few days after making the request.</p>


<p>A Department Use Only Shared drive is requested when an area/institute/center/department wants to treat their content similar to HSI. Please note that the restrictions are the same as an HSI Shared drive and there are no exceptions. Please only request a Department Use Only Shared drive when needed. HSI content <strong>cannot</strong> be stored in a Department Use Only shared drive.</p>

<h2>To Request a Secure Shared Drive</h2>


<p>There are 2 steps to create HSI or Department Use Only Shared drives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new AD group</li>
<li>Request a secure Shared drive</li>
</ol>


<h3>Step 1 - Create a New AD Group</h3>
<p>Use <a href="https://nd.service-now.com/nd_portal?sys_id=b84c8a3f37a40600f8b78ff1b3990e83&view=sp&id=sc_cat_item&table=sc_cat_item" target="_blank">this form</a> to create a new AD group. Choose <strong>AD and Google for HSI</strong> as the <em>Group Type</em>.</p>


<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The Google Group created here is required for Step 2. Once complete, proceed to request the Shared drive.</p>


<p><strong>More things to know:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We recommend creating a new AD group rather than renaming an existing one.
<ul>
<li>If renaming an existing group, only individual NetIDs can be added.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The AD group name will end in “-g”; this name will also be used for the Google Group.</li>
<li>Group membership is managed via <a href="https://groups.nd.edu" target="_blank">groups.nd.edu</a>.</li>
<li>Changes can take up to 6 hours to propagate.</li>
<li>For security, shared/departmental accounts cannot be added to HSI-access groups.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Step 2 - Request an HSI or Department Use Only Shared drive</h3>
<p>Use <a href="https://nd.service-now.com/nd_portal?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=6884e0631bb62c10c81c64207e4bcb9e" target="_blank">this form</a> to request one.</p>


<ul>
<li>Create a name for your Shared drive
<ul>
<li>HSI Shared drives will have "HSI" added to the beginning.</li>
<li>Department Use Only Shared drives will have "DeptUseOnly" added.</li>
<li>Do not use underscores in the name.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
